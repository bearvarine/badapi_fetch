This project was completed by David S. "Pat" Patterson on 2018-06-17.

This Node.js application attempts to meet the basic requirements as layed out in the
IQVIA take-home interview question instructions.

The application was built and tested on a Ubuntu 16.04 linux system,
with Node.js v8.11.1 and npm v5.6.0.

To run the application in its default run scenario, simply do the following:
1. cd to the ./fetch directory.
2. Install the node_modules by running 'npm install'.
3. Run the command 'node app'.

   - The program will start up and attempt to contact the web service specified
     in the instruction page.

   - If this is successful, it will then download all the tweets available in
     the time range specified (2016 - 2017).

   - The results are output into the file tweets.log in JSON format.

The program attempts to parameterize various details of the instructions
in a config.js file.  In this file you can find settings for the debug
level, tracing and assert control, data URL, date range, and max count
of records returned by the data URL.
